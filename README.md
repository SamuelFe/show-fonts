## CLI Font Viewer

A minimal way to view the characters of your fonts.
I wanted something like that to see which icons I had installed in my system so a could choose them to put in a config (like in a polybar module for example).

# Dependencies
`perl`

# OK.. how do I install?
You can select the contents inside `show-font` and save in a file with the name of `show-font` as well.
Then you will need to provide the permition to execute the script.
```
chmod +x show-font
```
You can move it to a directory inside your PATH as well if you want...

# Usage
```
./show-icons /path/to/font
```

# Example
