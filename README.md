## CLI Font Viewer

A minimal way to view the characters of your fonts.
I wanted something like that to see which icons I had installed in my system so a could choose them to put in a config (like in a polybar module for example).

# Dependencies
`perl`

# Usage
```
./show-icons /path/to/font
```

# Example
`![alt text](screenshot.png "Title")``
